These volumes indicate that the scale of the machinery is likely to be large with significant resource implications.\r\u2022 Water: many, but not all, DAC techniques have a significant water requirement.\r\u2022 Costs: it is unlikely that DAC from ambient air will be cost competitive with CCS, as the starting concentration of the carbon dioxide feedstock is so much lower. It would make economic sense to first exhaust all potential CCS opportunities before applying DAC. The exception to this would be if large quantities of extra low-carbon energy \u00ac\u00ac\u00ac(known as \u201cstranded energy\u201d) were available in locations close to geological storage sites.\r\u2022 Geological storage: DAC will compete with geological storage space with CCS from large stationary plants.",

In many cases it can lead to enhanced crop yields. However, it can also lead to increased production of methane, and cause impacts on the biological diversity of the soil.\r\u2022 Albedo effect: the addition of large amounts of biochar to soils may result in reduced albedo (ability of the surface of the earth to reflect heat energy from the sun), thereby counteracting some of the cooling benefit of removing carbon dioxide.\r\u2022 Fire impacts: if a land area into which biochar has been added is affected by fire (e.g. fire use as an agronomical practice, accidental fire, or even as the result of a warming climate), then the carbon stored may be released back into the atmosphere.",

Calcium and magnesium ion concentrations will become higher than historical levels, though.\r\u2022 Energy penalty and costs: the process for obtaining alkaline materials is likely to be costly both in economic and energy terms. There are few naturally occurring deposits of alkaline materials that could be added to the ocean, but it may be possible to manufacture such materials.\r\u2022 Logistics: to have a real impact on the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would require a massive mining, mineral processing and distribution industry.\r\u2022 Governance: the application of EW-O would involve governance challenges, as the ocean is a global commons (an international global resource).

Some of this carbon will eventually end up in the deep ocean where it will be effectively stored away from the atmosphere. Some parts of the ocean are deficient in micronutrients such as iron, which organisms need to grow. By adding iron filings, more photosynthesis can occur and more carbon can be transported from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. ",

Once iron is no longer a constraint, photosynthetic activity can increase up to the point that the next constraining factor limits growth (typically the availability of nitrate).\r\u2022 Logistics: some proponents of OF have suggested that it may be possible to boost macronutrients such as nitrate as a means of enhancing photosynthetic capacity. While that may be possible, the quantity of material that is required to boost photosynthesis may be impractical.\r\u2022 Impacts on marine biodiversity: serious environmental concerns have been raised about OF. The introduction of micronutrients into the ocean will alter its ecology, favouring certain types of organism over others that thrive in low-iron waters. In addition, increased photosynthetic activity could lead to increased ocean acidification and a decrease in dissolved oxygen.\r\u2022 Efficacy: it is not sufficient for photosynthetic activity to just increase \u2013 for the technique to have a positive impact on the climate, the carbon must be transferred from the atmosphere to the deep ocean.

Those experiments conducted without approval have been highly controversial. The results of the officially approved experiments have indicated, at least in some instances, that there has been a net carbon drawdown, but there are still many unanswered questions as to the long-term effects of this technique.

This ageing could have negative impacts on economies in the future, as health and pension costs increase while the proportion of people of working age reduces. In developed countries, this ageing trend is more established and is already putting pressure on health and welfare budgets. Many developing countries are expected to enter a period of rapid ageing soon.

Urban areas are expected to absorb all the population increase by 2050, and will also draw in some of the rural population.",

In the future inventions like 3D printers may have a significant impact on freight demand and could decouple it from GDP.

Quality of life can be improved by spending less time stuck on congested roads.  \r\rHowever, the development of public transport infrastructure and urban planning usually requires significant public investment, whereas the growth of car use involves the spending of mostly private money.

In contrast, car occupancy has decreased. An explanation might be the increasing global wealth allowing for more car ownership and greater diversity of activities and destinations available to people.

In Mexico different car registrations are restricted from the city center on certain days, forcing people to carpool more or switch to public transport.\r\rTechnological developments could also help increase freight load.

In some parts of the world, where many families own a car (or even two cars), these vehicles are often only used for a small proportion of the day and week. This is often expensive, and it may be that in future people begin to move away from owning their own vehicles.\r\rOne option in the future is hiring cars or motorbikes from a company or government scheme, or as an informal arrangements among households or neighbours, allowing people to drive similar distances as today, but using a fleet of shared vehicles.  Hiring a vehicle or car-sharing would decrease the stock of cars needed, and the associated manufacturing energy demand and emissions impacts. Signs of these trends are already emerging and some schemes have already achieved success in city areas.\r\rAn additional step could be self-driving or autonomous vehicles, which is a technology that could radically change the way we travel. They could offer all of the conveniences of taxis as well as maximizing the use time and road space, so if the cost become comparable or cheaper than owning a car, it could drastically decrease car ownership.

This was achieved by technology improvements (cylinder capacity and turbo charging) and regulatory efforts such as lower-limits for fleet efficiencies.\r\rIt may be harder for fossil-fuel-powered car engine efficiencies to make future improvements given the quick progress in the past few years. However, car efficiency could be improved by decreasing the average car weight so that less fuel is needed. Policy approaches might be able to increase average transport efficiency by setting more severe upper speed limits for cars which would run more efficiently at lower speeds \u2013 but this may not be politically acceptable.\r\rThe efficiency of planes has also improved over the last decades. The jumbo jet A380 is 12% more efficient than a Boeing 747.  Planes have been considerably optimised in the last years, possibly suggesting that fewer significant improvements can be expected. Replacing fossil fuel by hydrogen might not help to reduce the climate impact of flying as water vapour acts as a strong greenhouse gas. When directly emitted in the stratosphere, water vapour can persist for months and years and might also degrade the ozone layer. \r\rSignificant research efforts are going into low-emission vehicles, meaning that efficiency improvements are also likely for hydrogen-powered and electric vehicles.\r",

For passenger transport, public transport (especially electric trains, trams and buses) is about 5 to 10 times more energy-efficient than other forms of transport (e.g. cars and planes).\r\rFor freight transport, in 2011 light-duty vehicles had an efficiency of 10 litres gasoline equivalent (lge) per 100km and heavy-duty vehicle efficiency was 32 lge per 100km. The average global rate of improvement is 1-2% per year.

Miscellaneous appliances like laptops and DVD players are modelled separately.\r\rDespite continued improvements in energy efficiency, the amount of electricity being used on appliances in homes still increased globally between 2000 and 2010.   This is because of the growth in appliance ownership around the world (with a particular surge in the use of electronics and computers), but also because of changes in consumer preference. Many of the efficiency gains have been offset by people choosing larger appliances or ones with more functionality. For example, flat-screen TVs use less energy than cathode ray tube ones, but now households have more TVs per household with larger screens than before. \r\rAs well as technological developments, policy can have a big impact on the average efficiency of appliances by encouraging manufacturers to improve their products and encourage consumers to buy more efficient ones. Some countries have legally enforced standards so that all appliances sold must meet a certain level of efficiency.

      "If products had longer lifetimes, they would be replaced less often, meaning fewer new products would be manufactured each year. This would mean less energy and lower industrial emissions.\r\rFor high energy-using products such as cars and trains, there is a trade-off between extending product lifetimes (to reduce manufacturing emissions), or upgrading and replacing products to reduce annual energy usage. This is particularly significant when efficiency of new products may be improving quickly each year.\r\rWhile the optimal replacement rates for energy and emission reductions will vary for different products, research estimated that people currently replace objects much more frequently than we would if our objective were to minimise energy inputs. There is therefore significant potential to save energy and emissions by extending the product lifespans. \r\rAs well as increasing product lifespan, global emissions and energy consumption could be reduced by reducing global consumption of products. Currently consumption of products is correlated to GDP, therefore as the economies of developing countries expand, it is expected that consumption of goods will increase. ", 
      "There are several ways to increase the lifetime of products. Firstly, if products were made more durable, they could last longer before becoming degraded and no longer fit for use. For example, by heat-treating rail tracks, we could significantly increase wear resistance, and this has been shown to extend track life and hence reduce rail emissions by up to 50%. Products could be designed in a way that makes future upgrades much easier, allowing the product to keep pace with new designs (or fashion) without full replacement. Alternatively, when products are no longer required by one owner, more could be given or sold to new owners, rather than being thrown away. \r\rAs people get wealthier, they tend to consume more. However, if our global consumption pattern moved to consuming more service-based products (e.g. visiting spas, rather than going shopping), or more products that are less resource intensive (e.g. music and films in electronic form, rather than CDs and DVDs), it may be possible to partially decouple increased consumption from GDP growth and wellbeing, and hence reduce consumption of products per person by 2050.\r\rWithin the model, product demand is defined by other levers whenever possible.

      null, 
      "The carbon emissions and energy input associated with products, such as televisions (TVs) and cars, can be reduced in broadly three different ways. Firstly, design improvements, so that less material is required during product manufacture. Secondly, material switching, which involves either using less carbon-intensive materials for product manufacture, or making products from materials which improve the design of the product, therefore resulting in lower emissions from the use of the product during its lifespan. Thirdly, using more recycled materials can reduce energy and emissions.\r\rAllwood and Cullen (2012) estimated that by optimising product designs, we could use approximately 30% less metal per product globally, without affecting product quality. They also predicted that there would be potential to recycle 90% of steel and aluminium globally by optimising systems to maximise scrap collection and separation. There are similar opportunities to reduce the use of other virgin materials by design and increased re-use and recycling. ", 
      "Better design\rBy designing products with a specification to minimise material requirements, significant material savings could be achieved without compromising the technical requirements of the product. Examples of design improvements could be lighter steel and aluminium products (e.g. vehicles), buildings built with minimal structural steel, plastic products that are stronger and lighter than present, and optimising cement strengths.\rMaterial savings can also be achieved by improving manufacturing processes, so that less scrap is produced, and less material is required to make the same products. Currently, nearly half of all aluminium is converted into scrap rather than products in manufacturing processes.\r\rMaterial switching\rSwitching product materials to materials with lower greenhouse gas intensities could also reduce emissions from the manufacturing of goods. For example, cars and trucks could be manufactured in part from aluminium or carbon fibre rather than steel, planes could be made using carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, reducing their weight, or building structures could be made from timber rather than steel, to reduce the emission intensity of manufacture.\rIn the Global Calculator, material switching from steel to timber, steel to aluminium, steel to plastics, cement to timber, and cement to plastics are considered. However material substitution is highly complex, and there are other potential substitutions that are currently not modelled here.\rIt is important to note that there could be some disadvantages associated with the material switches modelled here: \r\u2022 Wood burns more easily and is less stable than steel and concrete. More wood is also required than metal to produce a product of considerable strength, however some of these limitations are now being addressed with new technologies such as cross lamination. \r\u2022 Timber can act as a \u2018carbon sink\u2019, with carbon from the atmosphere being stored in products. However, increasing timber demand could impact biodiversity, and the carbon stored in forests. Please refer to the land and food sector for the impacts of biomass.\r\u2022 Aluminium has significantly higher embodied energy and emissions associated with it than steel; however, it weighs much less than steel, so if used in vehicles the saving in weight can result in reduced fuel consumption. This leads to a trade-off between the up-front manufacturing energy for vehicles, and the energy used during a vehicle\u2019s life-time.  \r\rRecycling\rFor steel, most recycled metals are currently produced from scrap generated during production, rather than post-consumer scrap; these wastes are generally well sorted, aiding recycling. However, post-consumer scrap is forecast to increase, therefore separation will become critical and to maximise metals recycling new technologies may be required, for example, to remove copper from recycled steel. Future aluminium recycling rates are expected to decrease, mainly because the availability of aluminium scrap is forecast to be limited in the future. Carbon fibre products are difficult to recycle.\rIt is currently very energy intensive to recycle concrete materials, therefore this is seldom practiced. However, concrete re-use may be more common in the future, particularly if more concrete components are made in standardised units.\rPaper is already widely recycled, with around 60% of all paper being recycled in Europe and North America. The rate of paper recycling has been increasing steadily over the past decade, and it is projected that this trend will increase as less developed countries start to recycle more in the future.\r\rIf you have chosen a high level for this lever, the improvements in design could also translate into higher vehicle efficiency, so you may want to consider choosing a high level for the \u2018Transport Efficiency\u2019 lever as well.\rTo ensure your scenario is consistent, we recommend setting \u201cIron, Steel and Aluminium lever\u201d to the same value as this lever (Design, Materials and Recycling). This is because the chosen amount of recycling of steel defines the technologies used to manufacture steel products.",

Today, steel, iron and aluminium are used to make many products, including cars, ships, electrical equipment, electrical equipment, buildings, domestic appliances and consumer packaging.\r\rIn the future, metal manufacturing processes could become more energy-efficient as technology advances, resulting in fewer emissions being released per tonne of metal manufactured. For example, currently the majority of steel is manufactured using traditional blast oxygen furnaces (71% in 2011) and electric arc furnaces (24% in 2011), but the steel industry is exploring several new technologies (e.g. Hisarna and electric arc Direct Reduced Iron), which could reduce the energy requirements of the process.

See below for more detail on these technologies.\r\rEmissions per tonne of metal could also be reduced by using lower-carbon fuels to power the manufacturing processes. This could be achieved by (i) substituting the fuel used in the process for less carbon intensive fuel such as biomass, natural gas and hydrogen, (ii) using Combined Heat and Power (CHP) to provide the energy needs of the process, and (iii) capturing the carbon generated during the process to prevent its release to the atmosphere.

Some of the potential innovative technologies are discussed below.\rToday, traditional blast furnaces are used to produce steel. Fuel (often coke), iron ore and limestone are supplied to the furnace, along with a blast of air at 900 \u2013 1,300\u02daC, causing chemical reactions to produce \u2018pig iron\u2019. Pig iron pellets are then converted to primary steel using the Bessemer process, where oxygen is blown through the molten pig iron. More energy-efficient technologies for producing primary steel exist, and may become more prevalent in the future; for example, the HIsarna process can produce steel from molten pig iron directly from a specially-designed furnace, without having to convert the pig iron into pellets first; this simplifies the process and reduces the energy requirements.\r\rSecondary (recycled) steel is currently manufactured in electric arc furnaces, using electricity to generate the energy required to melt the used steel. Electric arc processes can also be used to make primary steel by feeding the electric arc furnace with direct reduced iron (DRI). Here iron ore is first converted to DRI in a gas-fuelled furnace at temperatures of 800 \u2013 1,000\u02daC, before being converted to steel in conventional electric arc furnaces. As this process does not use coke, the emissions are lower than traditional steel manufacture.\r\rPrimary aluminium is manufactured by the electrolysis of alumina in molten cryolite (the Hall-Heroult process), and therefore the process emission intensity depends on the emission intensity of the electricity, and the amount of electricity required by the process. Industry has been investigating ways to reduce the electricity consumption of the Hall-Heroult process for several decades.\r\rAnother way to improve efficiency is by using combined heat and power (CHP) energy generation to power the process, where heat that is produced during electricity generation is used to meet process heat demands.

Although designed for continuous operation, fossil fuel power plants can be switched on and off much faster than nuclear power stations, making them a better partner for renewable energy. In 2011, fossil fuels contributed 71% of global electricity supply. Fossil fuels were formed by anaerobic decomposition of organisms (prehistoric plants and animals) that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. Oil is a particularly versatile fuel being used for transport (cars, planes etc.) and electricity generation, as well as for manufacturing products like plastic. The question is therefore if we want to burn oil or use it for other purposes in the future. The main challenges might be the electrification of transport and replacing aviation fuel with bio fuels.\r",

For example, today, lignite (brown coal) is most carbon-intensive, emitting about 100,000 grams of CO2 per Gigajoule (g/GJ) followed by hard coal with 95,000 g/GJ. Oil has around 75,000 g/GJ. The fossil fuel with the lowest climate change impact is natural gas with 56,000 g/GJ. Currently electricity generation from coal is the cheapest because it is about four times more abundant than oil or natural gas. However in the future, carbon taxation and other regulatory means are expected to increase the costs for coal and favour natural gas. The average lifetime of fossil fuel power plants is around 30-50 years. All of them need several decades to recover the costs of their initial investment, so this might hinder the change towards natural gas. Given the long lifespan of thermal power plants, another solution could be the usage of biomass as fuel. If the user selects a high output of solid biomass, the model will automatically allocate some of this to electricity generation if \u201ccoal\u201d is selected.

As described below, efficient technologies are already available, but long power plant lifetimes of around 50 years make market adaptation relatively slow. Further technological improvements may reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the cost for highly efficient technologies. Increases in carbon taxation could also speed up the transition to more efficient power plant technologies. While Japan and South Korea mainly employ efficient coal power technologies (more than 70% of all coal power plants) most other major industrial nations have relatively inefficient power plants (less than 40% of all coal power plants) due to their low initial investment costs and the high lifespans. This shows the large potential for efficiency improvement.  ", 
      "It is worth considering the three types of power plant separately \u2013 gaseous (for natural gas), liquid (oil) and solid (coal or possibly biomass) fuel. Gaseous fuel: There are two main types of gas-fired power plants. The open-cycle gas turbine (OCGT) consists of a single compressor/gas turbine being connected to an electricity generator. About two-third of the generated energy is used to compress air for the combustion process. The second technology is combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGT) that basically consist of the same components as an OCGT. However, the turbine exhaust is re-used to generate energy with a heat recovery steam engine.\r\rThe thermal efficiency of OCGT lies currently between 35 \u2013 42% and is expected to increase up to 45% by 2020. The thermal efficiency of CCGT lies currently between 52 \u2013 60% and is expected to increase up to 64% by 2020. While the initial investment cost is slightly higher for CCGT, the annual operation and maintenance costs are much lower ($73/kWh compared to $210/MWh for OCGT) today. Building CCGT is therefore more beneficial in the long run in terms of costs and carbon dioxide emissions.\r\rLiquid fuel: The technological concepts for oil fired power plants are very similar to natural gas fired power plants. The model considers two types of plants: low efficiency power plants (<50% efficiency) and high efficiency power plants (>50% efficiency). Similar to gaseous fuel, higher efficiencies can be achieved when re-using the exhaust for power generation.\r\rSolid fuel: There are three main technologies for power generation from coal. In all three, coal is pulverised into fine powder, and the larger surface area allows for a more efficient combustion process. The pressure and temperature in the combustion chamber are the main difference between subcritical, supercritical and ultra-supercritical power plants.\rThe thermal efficiency of coal fired power plants increases with temperature and pressure, leading to efficiency levels of around 38% for subcritical, 43% for supercritical and 45% for ultra-supercritical power plants. The initial investment costs for super critical power plants are about 10 \u2013 20% higher than for subcritical ones and about 10% lower than for ultra-supercritical ones.\r\rIf the user selects a pathway with high solid biomass, the model will automatically allocate some biomass to be used in the solid fuel power plants.  For more detail on this, see the \u201csolid / liquid / gas\u201d lever description.",

It can produce a reliable supply of power, unlike some renewables such as wind and solar which are intermittent. Once built, a reactor has a lifespan of around 40 years and perhaps longer. If power plants are located close to buildings with heat demand, then the waste heat produced in the generating process can be used in district heating systems rather than being released into the atmosphere. This reduces the need for high-carbon sources of heat like gas. \r\rHowever, nuclear power has disadvantages too. Nuclear accidents, though rare, can have serious and long-term consequences. The safe disposal and storage of the radioactive waste produced by nuclear processes is also a serious challenge, as some of the substances have a half-life of many thousand \u2013 and even millions \u2013 of years. These concerns mean that some countries and organisations do not support the use of this technology.  Even in countries that support the use of nuclear power, the planning process can be long and difficult, as local residents may object to having a power plant near their homes.

As it is not always windy, about 15 \u2013 50 % of the capacity is actually used at any given time, and this is very dependent on where a turbine is located.  Wind power has been used for centuries to mill flour or pump water from land below sea level. In 2011, there were close to 200,000 operating wind turbines, totalling 238 GW of capacity and producing around 3% of the world\u2019s electricity.

The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) forecasts a cumulative installed capacity of 750 GW by 2020.The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects that 80% of the growth in wind power until 2035 will be onshore.

The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) assessed the emissions to be 11-12 g of carbon dioxide equivalent per kWh, which mainly arises from the production of the wind turbine. This is considerably lower than for other low carbon power sources such as solar or geothermal energy. In contrast to nuclear energy, wind energy does not produce any toxic waste that has to be stored safely for thousands of years.\r\rHowever, wind energy has also several disadvantages. Wind farms cover large areas of land that could otherwise be used differently e.g. for natural forest or housing. Ecological damage may be caused if bird migration is hindered. Since wind blows very inconsistently, the energy generation of wind turbines varies significantly. Currently, gas and coal power plants have to balance out this variation. However, in future, intelligent grids and storage techniques might be able to manage this in a smart way, and the battery capacity of electric vehicles might be used to store wind energy (for example, during night-time when the energy demand is low). Additionally, the aesthetic perception, noise pollution and shading effects can be important for people living close to wind turbines. Therefore, wind farms can usually not be built close to areas with high population densities. In contrast, wind farms and agriculture sharing the same area might be a promising combination for efficient land use.\r\rWhen choosing levels 3 or 4, land use for wind power will be significant and adaptations may be needed to the electricity supply system. The introduction of electric cars and the development of high performing storage systems might help to achieve the transition to more wind energy. \r\r",

Every year, 1.5 \u00d7 1018 kWh of solar power reaches the earth\u2019s surface, which is more than 10,000 times the current global energy demand.\r\rThere are different technologies to harvest solar energy. The most popular is photovoltaics (PV) from crystalline silicon with efficiencies of around 16% (currently about 80 to 95 % of the PV market). The rest of the PV market is shared between amorphous Silicon, Cadmium-Telluride (CaTe) and Copper-Indium-Gallium-Diselenide (CIGS). In 2011, the global capacity of PV was 70 GW, of which 80% was installed in just a few countries such as Germany, Spain and Japan. \r\rAnother approach is Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). Mirrors concentrate light on an absorbing device which heats up a thermal fluid that drives a conventional steam turbine. Typical CSP plants have a capacity of 0.01 \u2013 0.08 GW and an efficiency of 14 to 16%. As the sun is not always shining and only direct sunlight is correctly concentrated by the mirrors, about 25 to 30% of the capacity is used for electricity generation depending on the location. In 2011, a capacity of 1.6 GW was operating, mainly in Spain and the United States. \r  \r", 
      "Solar PV is a strongly growing technology, which capacity increases of around 40% per year in the last couple of years. In recent years this was mainly due to financial support from governments (e.g. China, India, Germany and Spain). The price for crystalline silicon solar cells is continuously falling, reaching a level below $0.40 per Watt peak in 2014 according to Bloomberg. This is cheap enough to achieve cost parity in countries with high solar irradiation such as Italy and Spain. It is therefore likely that solar PV will continue to grow fast in the future, with prices for solar PV likely to decrease even further.\r\rLike all technologies, PV is not completely carbon neutral, as the purification process of silicon in particular is very energy intensive. After around 3 years of operation, the initial carbon emissions are saved, and lifetimes easily exceed 20 years. Other technologies, such as organic PV and some thin film technologies are less carbon intensive. It is possible that one of those technologies might overtake silicon, with increasing governmental spending in solar R&D.\r\rThe cost for concentrated solar power (CSP) is currently higher than for solar PV. However an advantage of CSP is that the generated energy can be stored in a molten salt storage system over a period of several hours which may enable it to serve peak loads on the same day.\r\rElectricity generated from CSP could also be used elsewhere. The goal of the Desertec consortium, for instance, was to harvest solar power in North Africa and transfer it with an efficient grid to Europe. A key concern of this type of projects is the very high investment cost. Another major challenge for CSP is that it requires a lot of water, in what are usually very dry areas. Additionally, electricity transport with the current grid technology would suffer from considerable energy loss over such a long distance and therefore further effort in R&D is needed. Besides technical, financial and regulatory drawbacks, the safety and security of solar installations is becoming a big challenge in developing countries. As remote installations may lack proper security arrangements, there may be problems of theft and asset destruction which may deter new investors. \r\rTo choose levels 3 or 4, you would need to believe that solar power will have a considerable share in the energy mix of 2050.

      "Geothermal energy is thermal energy that originates mainly from the radioactive decay of minerals. This energy can either be used directly for heating or electricity generation. Geothermal energy is considered as a renewable source of energy because the energy extracted from the earth is negligible compared to the amount of energy stored in the core.\r\rIn 2012, the global capacity for geothermal electricity generation was 11.6 GW, and the capacity of directly used geothermal heat was about 28 GW. Around 24 counties used geothermal electricity and 70 countries used geothermal heat. Geothermal power plants have traditionally been built on the edges of tectonic plates, since the temperatures close to the surface are higher. The maximum potential lies in countries located on the so-called \u201cRing of Fire\u201d, a zone of major seismic activity including volcanoes and earthquakes in the basin of the Pacific Ocean. This is why the United States, the Philippines and Indonesia are the countries with the highest geothermal capacity in 2011.\r\rAn optimistic outlook from the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that geothermal electricity could have 3.5% of the world\u2019s energy generation. \r", 
      "Geothermal has several benefits compared to other energy sources. In particular the minimal freshwater and land requirements are strong advantages. A geothermal plant uses on average an area of 3.5 km2 per GW, which is about 90% less than for coal and 70% less than for wind farms. In terms of fresh water, geothermal uses 20 litres per MWh compared to more than 1,000 litres per MWh that are usually needed for coal electricity generation.\r\rIn contrast, geothermal energy also has disadvantages. Although being a renewable source of energy, power generation does need to be monitored as there is evidence for local depletion \u2013 ground and groundwater temperatures can be reduced, resulting in a reduction of power plant efficiency. Also during the process of thermal electricity generation, greenhouse gases are dissolved from the ground which are subsequently released in the atmosphere - this effect is comparably small so that carbon dioxide equivalent emissions over the lifespan of a geothermal power plant is still lower than for solar cells but higher than for wind, hydro and nuclear power (IPCC). Another issue might be the limited amount of well-suited sites with optimal power generation efficiencies on edges of tectonic plates. If geothermal is promoted further in the future, lower plant efficiencies have to be accepted.\r\rTo choose levels 3 or 4, you would need to believe that geothermal power plants will also be built at locations with lower efficiencies, which would involve higher economic costs.\r",

Solar and wind energy is generated whenever the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, regardless of the level of demand, but by using storage, electricity can be stored during off-peak time and released when needed.\r\rEnergy storage technologies could include a variety of battery technologies such as sodium-sulphur batteries, advanced lead acid batteries, flow batteries, and lithium ion batteries for utility-scale storage. Many of these storage systems could be used to store off-peak power generated by renewable technology. Pumped storage based on hydroelectricity and compressed-air energy storage (CAES) provide larger storage capacities of more than 0.2 GW per unit.\r\rIn 2011, there was around 120 GW of electricity storage plants, 99% relying on pumped storage and mainly located in OECD countries.

CAES, however, is still at an experimental stage, with the challenge of comparably low storage efficiencies of around 40% (compared to 70-75% for pumped storage). Improvement is needed to make CAES a viable option.\r\rSince storage techniques are so important for renewable energies, countries must invest in related research and development. In order to accomplish this goal, an appropriate regulatory framework has to be set in the coming years.

This value represents the effective calorie intake by person and excludes losses along the supply chain (currently approximately 24% of food energy content). This average value is greater than the recommended consumption by the World Health Organisation of 2,100 kcal per person per day. However, food consumption is not distributed evenly throughout the world, and in some regions extremes exist, such as undernourishment and obesity. For example, approximately 805 million people in the world do not currently have enough food to lead a healthy, active life. On the other hand, in 2010, more than 1.4 billion adults were overweight (BMI > 25) of which 500 million were obese (BMI > 30).\r\rPeople living in developed countries generally consume more calories than in developing countries. For example, in 2011 people in the USA and the EU consumed on average 2,729 and 2,520 kcal per person per day respectively, whilst in Bangladesh people consumed on average 1,823 kcal per person per day. It has therefore been projected that food consumption will increase in the future, as people in developing countries move to higher-calorie diets. For example, Alexandratos and Bruinsma (2012) projected that food consumption will increase by 11% between 2007 and 2050.

Increased demand for food could be met either through increases in yields or an expansion of agricultural land. Increases in the production of food from each unit of existing agricultural land (the yield) may be able to increase food supplies enough to supply the additional food required for 8.3 to 10.9 billion people by 2050 without having to convert native ecosystems to agricultural land.\r\rHowever, agricultural land expansion could put pressure on existing forests if this yield increase doesn\u2019t take place.

Non-ruminants are also known as monogastric animals and include chicken and pigs; these animals have simple, single-chambered stomachs and are therefore less efficient than ruminants at extracting energy from fibrous plant-based food.\r\rThe share of ruminant meat in the average global diet has reduced steadily since the 1970s (although owing to increasing meat consumption, absolute production has increased), whereas the share of non-ruminant meat (in particular poultry) has been increasing.

As the world\u2019s food needs are expected to increase, more land will be needed for food crops which may lead to deforestation. Improving crop yields can reduce this pressure on forests and other natural habitats. \r", 
      "Many experts consider that there is significant potential for crop yields to continue to increase to 2050, particularly in developing countries where the difference between actual yields and potential yields based on agro-ecological parameters is large. There are several ways to increase crop yields, including improving crop varieties to increase their (i) photosynthetic efficiencies, (ii) tolerance to pests, diseases, saline conditions and drought, and (iii) efficiencies of water and nutrient use.  This can involve traditional plant breeding methods (annual selection of higher yielding seeds, and the development of new varieties), marker assisted breeding and/or genetic modification (GM: the insertion of specific genes into the genes of a target plant, often from a separate species).\r\rTraditional plant breeding methods have been adopted for centuries, whilst GM methods have only been developed over the past few decades. However, GM crops are already planted on 170 million hectares (WRI, 2013), representing 12% of total cropland area in 2011; the majority (90%) of GM crops are currently grown in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina and India. The potential implications of GM crops are currently heavily debated. Issues of contention include the potential ecosystem impacts and toxicity of GM crops, human health and safety and the socioeconomic impacts on farmers related to the higher cost, and ownership and control of GM seeds and products in comparison to conventional production practices. \rThe use of more fertilisers and irrigation can also increase crop yields, if the required resources (water, energy) are available. However, as well as being energy and greenhouse gas intensive, increasing these inputs can have negative impacts on the environment. For example, fertilisers can cause eutrophication (a rapid increase in algal growth which starves the water of oxygen, killing fish and other creatures) if allowed to run off into water bodies, affecting local biodiversity. Irrigation can affect local hydrological conditions, impacting soil and water quality. However, if best practice is applied, these impacts should be minimised. \r\rTo represent a move towards an organic farming system in the Global Calculator, crop yields are likely to be lower than industrialised systems, therefore between Level 1 to level 2 for crop yields would be most appropriate. On a global average, organic crop yields tend to be lower than those of industrialised systems. This would likely result in more land being required to grow crops compared to industrialised systems, and hence could result in deforestation to make way for more agricultural land unless offset to some extent by a concurrent increase in land use efficiency. However, organic farming could have benefits on existing arable land by, for example, reducing soil erosion, the use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, and increasing biodiversity.\r\rFinally, it is important to bear in mind that climate change could impact crop yields in the future. For example, increases in temperature could result in increased weather variability, more frequent and intense extreme events, and changes in precipitation, which in turn could lead to reduced and more variable crop yields. On the other hand, increased carbon dioxide levels could potentially result in improved yields for some types of crops.  Low to moderate yield increases (level 1 to 2) are likely to be the most appropriate if you have chosen a pathway with high temperature increases (>4 degrees) to reflect the potential adverse impacts of climate change on agricultural production.",

However, if arable land is cultivated less intensively, more land may be required. ", 
      "The Multiple Cropping Index (MCI) is a measure of the total harvested area for crops, in comparison to the total arable land dedicated to crops. Currently, in some warm climates with irrigation, or sufficient rainfall, crops are harvested more than once per year, hence the MCI is greater than 1; for example, the MCI of China was 1.45 in 2013 (Langeveld et al, 2013). However, if land is cropped less than once per year (e.g. some land is left fallow), the MCI is less than 1; for example, the MCI of the USA was 0.84 in 2013. If increased cropping intensities caused the global average MCI to increase in the future, less land would be required to produce the required amount of food, hence the land use efficiency would increase.\rSome studies have predicted that significant increases in cropping intensities could be technically feasible in the future, via more multi-cropping and reduced fallow periods. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012) project that between 2005/7 and 2050, the global average MCI will increase from 0.88 to 0.92; this represents a change in the land required to produce the crops (assuming constant yields) from 100% in 2005/7 to 95.5% in 2050. \r\rHowever, the environmental implications of such increased cropping intensities will depend on where and how the intensification occurs. For example, long-term fallow land that is harvested infrequently can have substantial carbon reserves and provide important ecosystem services, therefore cultivating this type of land more frequently could result in increased carbon emissions to the atmosphere, and declining ecosystem services (WRI, 2013). However, if arable land that is technically suitable for multi-cropping is used, such schemes could result in improvements in land-use efficiency, without having detrimental environmental implications.  In contrast, with mismanaged land use, such as multi-cropping on land not suitable to such practices, yields could decrease because of soil degradation, soil loss and/or desertification and could result in a net increase of land area required to produce the same amount of output (decrease in land use efficiency).\r\rAnother way to increase the integration of land use, and potentially the land-use efficiency, is to use agroforestry, where trees and shrubs are integrated on land with crops and/or livestock production. Agroforestry schemes are already deployed in many regions, including Latin America, Asia and Africa. As well as potentially reducing overall land requirements, there are other potential environmental benefits of such schemes, including fixing nitrogen in the soils, reducing soil erosion, increasing soil organic matter, and increasing pasture yields in hot regions by providing shade and hence reducing animal stress. For example, in Kenya, Zambia and Malawi, nitrogen-fixing tree species (e.g. Faidherbia) are being intercropped with crops, improving the nitrogen content of soils. In other regions, shrubs with high-protein leaves (e.g. Leucaena) are being inter-cropped to provide forage for livestock (WRI, 2013). These schemes have proved very successful and are therefore increasingly being deployed in other countries.",

      "Ruminant livestock (e.g. cows and other bovines, sheep and goats) can be reared on pasture or in intensive and semi-intensive feed-lot systems where they are fed on grains and residues. Currently, intensively produced beef represents approximately 6% of all beef, and 1% of all sheep and goat meat produced globally. Since the 1990s, livestock production has been shifting from more developed countries to developing countries, and this pattern is projected to continue towards 2050 (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). Developing countries currently produce less than 1% of their beef from intensive systems, whereas developed countries produce around12% from such systems. Therefore the shift of beef production to developing countries could result in reduced intensification of beef production. However, intensification of livestock systems is generally associated with economic growth, therefore it is expected that there will be a gradual shift towards more intensive feed-lot systems in developing countries in the future; this could compensate for the shift of livestock production from developed to developing countries. \r\rIt is expected that global average feed conversion efficiencies of grain/residue fed animals will increase in the future due to genetic improvements, as well as improved animal feeds.\r", 
      "Livestock produced in intensive systems are generally much more efficient at converting biomass food to meat, and therefore require much less land than pasture-fed animals. For example, in 2011 an area the size of a football pitch would typically yield ~ 380,000 kcal per year of intensively managed beef, but only ~ 26,000 kcal per year of pasture fed beef, i.e., almost 15 times less. Shifting more towards intensively produced animals could therefore free up land for other uses, such as newly established forests and bioenergy plantations. \r\rHowever, intensive livestock operations are currently a source of environmental and health problems. Large amounts of manure are produced in confined areas, and its collection, storage and application to land can pose significant challenges; for example, if too much manure is added to nearby land, it can run-off into local water systems, causing water and soil pollution. There are also concerns of odour and air pollution associated with feedlot systems. Another issue is that antibiotics are often used in large quantities in feedlot systems, with potential health implications for humans (e.g. increased human resistance to antibiotics). \r\rMany people are also concerned about the health and welfare impacts on animals by keeping them in confined, intensive conditions, as well as using selective breeding (for example, to make them more muscular).\r",

It is thought that there is significant potential to increase pasture-fed livestock yields globally, particularly in countries with land availability for livestock production or by increasing the animal density in existent pasture systems.", 
      "Pasture land currently covers 3.4 billion hectares of the world, representing 26% of the overall global land area (excluding deserts, ice sheets, degraded lands). If global consumption of pasture-fed ruminant meat increases in the future, more pasture land will be required unless increases in efficiencies are able to counterbalance this increased meat requirement. Increases in pasture area could lead to further deforestation, with the associated greenhouse gas emissions and impacts on biodiversity. Alternatively, if pasture yields and other land use efficiency measures (controlled by the \u201cLand-use efficiency\u201d lever which allows greater multi-cropping and land use integration) were increased significantly, this pasture expansion could be prevented, or even reversed so that some pasture land is freed up in the future and used for either reforestation or dedicated bioenergy crop production.  \r\rThere are several methods for increasing pasture yields. For example, pastures could be planted with grasses and legumes that are more digestible than typical pasture forage, and fields could be fertilised to produce greater quantities of forage. This could increase the number of animals that the land could support, as well as raising the feed conversion efficiency of the animals (if the forage is more digestible). Grains and oilseed meals could also be used as a supplement feed to grass, to help maintain the animal\u2019s growth during dry or cold seasons. \r\rAlternatively, grazing methods can be improved so that pasture land is used more efficiently; for example, by rotating animals quickly around different areas of a field so that grass growth is optimised, or by mixing cattle and sheep grazing so that their different grazing patterns complement each other. Agro-livestock integration can also maximise the land use and increase the overall productivity. Finally, genetic improvements could also be used to increase the feed conversion ratio of ruminants, and reduce their production of methane.",
